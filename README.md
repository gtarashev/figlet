# figlet
My own figlet implementation written in rust. I made this to practice rust and it is a small project so I will not be updating it in the future, unless I think of a much better way of doing something.

## Installation
Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/gtarashev/figlet`) then change into the directory (`cd figlet`) and run `cargo build` to download dependencies and to build all of the binaries.

## Usage 
Use `cargo run $args` from the main directory. Or run `cargo run --help` to display a little help messsage.
